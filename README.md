## python-hand-tracker

the project uses opencv-python and mediapipe to track and display the position and approximate orientation of fingers and palms on up to 2 hands at a time.
The capture framerate has been lowered to 24 fps due to constraints in code efficiency.

the file HandTrackingModule.py contains a script identical to the NewHandTracker.py file, available as a modular function to allow for use in any external scripts.
